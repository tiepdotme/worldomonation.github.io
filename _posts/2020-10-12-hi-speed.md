I have high hopes for Apple at the _Hi, Speed_ event tomorrow, if only because it's been a long 4 years with my current iPhone 7.

That iPhone 7 has been to 3 continents with me, taken countless photos and has had its battery replaced once (remember the battery slowdown debacle?).

Now, after an unfortunate fall (while playing Pokemon Go) the screen has been cracked everywhere. It's time to move on.
